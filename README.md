Game Time is a client project that allows users to keep track of their favorite board games. The project was presented in 2 days and improvised it with CSS, Bootstrap, and Ajax.

##Solution

The home page listed out all the board games available in the database. Users can comment on board games and add them to their favorite list. In order to do so, users have to register and log in. The user's profile page will show all the favorite board games.

The search bar at the top allows the users to search board games or other users, and add them.
